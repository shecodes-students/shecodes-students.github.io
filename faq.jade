      a(data-toggle='collapse', href='#collapseOne') Why yet another online learning platform?
  #collapseOne.panel-collapse.collapse.in

      p.answer
        | We have a different scope than sites like Codecademy, CodeSchool or Treehouse (to name a few). We are not competing with these sites but complement their offerings.
        br
        br
        | We curate learning resources that are freely available on the net and offer guidance on what to learn when. We have opinions about what technologies are the moving parts of tomorrow&apos;s Internet and encourage our students to look at them first and then leave the path to go on adventures on their own or in small groups.
        br
        br
        | Instead of having a closed learning environment, we integrate with sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow and use real tools to better prepare our students for real projects.
        br
        br
        | From the beginning, we accompany the training of technical skills with the human side of coding. This includes the history of programming and presenting the authors behind the tools we use. Most importantly, the platform pairs students with similar skill levels and gives them assignments to collaborate on. It then moderates a peer review process to give them feedback by real humans rather than algorithms.

      a(data-toggle='collapse', href='#collapseTwo') So, you use tutorials made by others?
  #collapseTwo.panel-collapse.collapse.in
    .panel-body
      p.answer
        | Yes. Plus free text books, screencasts and podcasts. We also encourage those students who can afford it to create Gittip and Flattr accounts to support authors of materials they like.
        br
        br
        | We create our own interactive tutorials only when we feel that a particular topic is not covered extensively by resources that can be accessed freely, or where these resources do not meet our quality criteria. We favour helping out to improve pre-existing resources before we make our own. Just like we tell our students to treat open-source projects.
        br
        br
        | We believe that not only this approach scales better but also makes for a smoother transition once our students leave she.codes and continue learning on-the-job.

      a(data-toggle='collapse', href='#collapseThree') Why is it exclusively for women and girls?
  #collapseThree.panel-collapse.collapse.in
    .panel-body
      p.answer
        | The fact that only a tiny fraction of software developers are female (1.5% of all open-source authors) tells us that there is a huge potential of talent that for some reason is not attracted to the fun and extremely rewarding art form that coding is. The huge success of initiatives like Rails Girls tells us however that it is not the challenges of mastering technology that keep women from writing software. Obviously, being female-only greatly increases the attractiveness of a learning environment to women. Why is that? Good question!

      a(data-toggle='collapse', href='#collapseFive') Why are you teaching crappy JavaScript instead of my favourite language x?
  #collapseFive.panel-collapse.collapse.in
    .panel-body
      p.answer
        | True, JavaScript has its quirks. However building web applications is what we teach and JS is the only programming language of web browsers, so there is no way around it. Instead of merely accepting it as a necessity, we fully embrace JavaScript in the browser and on the server. NodeJS is a rising star on the server-side and is without a doubt here to stay. Being able to develop a complete web site, front-end to back-end, in just one language that you know really well is much more effective and less confusing than dealing with two languages between which you have to split your development time.

      a(data-toggle='collapse', href='#collapseSix') Isn&rsquor;t in-person training more effective than online learning?
  #collapseSix.panel-collapse.collapse.in
    .panel-body
      p.answer
        | It probably is. However, it is not easy for everyone to attend classes in person. Be it because they are living in a rural area or are not as flexible time-wise (think kids, job).
        br
        br
        | However, remote teaching does not mean that it is conducted by machines. We dislike automised evaluation of assignments, because we found it to be frustrating and error-prone. Nothing is more discouraging than an algorithm that does not detect that your answer is a valid solution to the given problem.
        br
        br
        | On she.codes, students are not alone. They collaborate in real-time in pairs on an assignment while having a conversation over a peer-to-peer audio link. The assignment is then reviewed by other, more experienced students to give valuable feedback. We believe that this approach combines the best parts of in-person training with the flexibility of remote learning that is needed by many.
        br
        br
        | However, the site will inform students about upcoming events in the vicinity, and we will organise casual meet-ups.

        | Why is it free? Am I the product? Are you selling my data? What is the business model?
  #collapseSeven.panel-collapse.collapse.in
    .panel-body
      p.answer
        | Very good question! The first lectures are free because we believe that everyone should have a chance to evaluate our style of teaching and the site&rsquor;s features, and should be able to get a feel for the community. If you make it past the free stage, you will already be skilled enough to make some money as a web designer. We think, from that point on, it is fair to ask for a small fee to cover our costs.

        | We actively work on putting people into more attractive jobs that finish the more advanced stages. Being the matchmaker between our best students and attractive tech companies worldwide is another source of income. So, yes, in a way, we use the knowledge of the fact that you are awesome (which is a data point about you) to make money (in the way that recruitment firms do). If that is not in your interest, we won&rsquor;t work on getting you job offers. It is opt-in.

  #collapseNine.panel-collapse.collapse.in

        | We are promoting efficient workflows and tools that do one thing good. Vim is an incredibly efficient code editor and worth the initial investment of learning it with gamified tutorials. There is no way around version control and git is by far the most common and powerful tool for it. And for serious work, you have to master the command line.
