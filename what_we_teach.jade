  | We will teach students everything they need to know to become a full stack developer working in a distributed, agile team. This includes hard and soft skills.

h3 Facts
p.blurb
  | Throughout the world of she.codes, you will find and collect flash cards that not only teach you facts you need for work, but also background information about the people that created the tools you use as well as fun facts about the history of programming. Nerd partys will be so much more fun! And if you like, you can take part in multi-player quiz games and earn some extra credibility.

h3 Communication
p.blurb
  | Programming is much more than writing code. It is about communication between humans. True, we write code that is interpreted by machines, but only if we are capable of writing code that is readable by humans too and if we know how to efficiently talk about this code, we will become a successful member of the community. And with the help of this community, we will build amazing things.

  | The founders of github.com coined the term Social Coding. It stands for a new, more open and more collaborative approach to software development. It is much easier now to incrementally improve on other people's projects and realize an idea more quickly. This is a radically more effective way to building software. It requires a set of social skills that are as important as the technical skills. At she.codes we especially emphasize these topics:
