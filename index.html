                    <p class="blurb">she.codes is like a role playing game - we challenge you with a quest and provide you with pointers to resources. You then go out into the wild forests of the Internets and pick up the gems of wisdom others put there for you. Get sidetracked as you like, but please return safely home, where you can show off what you’ve learned by taking the quiz that ends each section. Answering correctly will level up your set of skills and will unlock the next level.</p>
                    <p class="blurb">Instead of putting you into a closed learning environment, we teach you how to use the Internet in order to build the Internet. We curate online resources such as interactive tutorials, screencasts, free text books and podcasts, and fill in the blanks where needed.</p>
                    <p class="blurb">As you learn, you will earn badges for special achievements and you will encounter, and pair up with, other she.coders to collaborate on assignments. Your pairs will come from all over the planet, and you will have voice conversations while you code with them. When you have finished an assignment, more experienced members of the community will review your code and give you feedback. Soon you will be the one to give feedback, and you will level up your code review skills by doing so.</p>
                  <p class="blurb">We will show you more efficient ways of writing code, and your productivity will rise continuously.</p>
                  <p class="blurb">Once you know enough, the assignments will turn into more serious challenges, and what you do starts to actually affect other people’s lives. For example, we might assign you to a non-profit open source project that aims to improve some aspect of everyday life for someone.</p>
                  <p class="blurb">You will never be alone, and you will soon pass on what you’ve learned while picking up new techniques from your fellow coders.</p>
                  <p class="blurb">You will find and collect flash cards along the way that not only teach you facts you need for work, but also background information about the people that created the tools you use. If you like, you can take part in multi-player quiz games for fun and credits.</p>
                  <p class="blurb">We will keep you updated about user meet-ups in your neighbourhood, where you have a chance to meet your fellow she.coders in person.</p>
                  <p class="blurb">You will feel at home on any Unix server you encounter, because we don’t simulate. The technologies you use right from the beginning are the technologies that power some of the biggest sites on the web.</p>
                  <p class="blurb">Before you know it, you will be one of those experts that software companies all around the world are desperate to employ.</p>

We have opinions about what technologies are the moving parts of tomorrow's Internet and encourage our students to look at them first and then leave the path to go on adventures on their own or in small groups. <br><br>Instead of having a closed learning environment, we integrate with sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow and use real tools to better prepare our students for real projects.<br><br>From the beginning, we accompany the training of technical skills with the human side of coding. This includes the history of programming and presenting the authors behind the tools we use. Most importantly, the platform pairs students with similar skill levels and gives them assignments to collaborate on. It then moderates a peer review process to give them feedback by real humans rather than algorithms.</p>

                      <p class="answer">Yes. Plus free text books, screencasts and podcasts. We also encourage those students who can afford it to create Gittip and Flattr accounts to support authors of materials they like.<br><br>We create our own interactive tutorials only when we feel that a particular topic is not covered extensively by resources that can be accessed freely, or where these resources do not meet our quality criteria. We favour helping out to improve pre-existing resources before we make our own. Just like we tell our students to treat open-source projects.<br><br>We believe that not only this approach scales better but also makes for a smoother transition once our students leave she.codes and continue learning on-the-job.</p>

                    <p class="answer">The fact that only a teeny tiny fraction of software developers are female (1.5% of open-source authors are female) tells us that there is a huge potential of talent that for some reason is not attracted to the fun and extremely rewarding art form that coding is. The huge success of initiatives like Rails Girls tells us that it is not the challenges of mastering technology that keep women from considering a career in the software industry. Obviously, having a female-only environment greatly reduces fear. Why is that? Good question!</p>

                    <p class="answer">True, JavaScript has certain disadvantages. As building web sites is what we teach, and it's the only programming language of web browsers, there is no way around it. Instead of merely accepting it as a necessity, we fully embrace JavaScript in the browser and on the server. NodeJS is a rising star on the server-side and is without a doubt here to stay. Being able to develop a complete web site, front-end and back-end, in just one language that you know really well is much more effective and less confusing than dealing with two languages between which you split your development time.<br><br>Besides, JavaScript is awesome - you just didn’t realise it yet!</p>

                    <p class="answer">It probably is. However, it is not easy for everyone to attend classes in person. Be it because they are living in a rural area or are not as flexible time-wise (think kids, job). However, we dislike automised evaluation of assignments, because we found it to be frustrating and error-prone. Nothing is more discouraging than an algorithm that does not detect that your code is a valid solution to the given problem.<br><br>On she.codes, students are not alone. They collaborate in real-time in pairs on an assignment while having a conversation over a peer-to-peer audio link. The assignment is then reviewed by other, more experienced, students to give valuable feedback. We believe that this approach combines the best parts of in-person training with the flexibility of remote learning that is needed by many.<br><br>Having said that, the site will inform students about upcoming events in the vicinity, and we will organise casual meet-ups.</p>

                    <p class="answer">Very good question! The first lectures are free because we believe that everyone should have a chance to evaluate our style of teaching and the site’s features, and should be able to get a feel for the community. If you make it past the free stage, you will already be skilled enough to be chased by recruiters that work for start-up companies and will be able to make your living as a freelance web designer. We think, from that point on, it is fair to ask for a small fee to cover our costs. <br><br>We actively work on putting people into more attractive jobs that finish the more advanced stages. Being the matchmaker between our best students and attractive tech companies worldwide is another income stream. So, yes, in a way, we use the knowledge of the fact that you are awesome (which is a data point about you) to make money in the way that recruitment firms do. If that is not in your interest, we won’t work on getting you job offers. It is opt-in.</p>
